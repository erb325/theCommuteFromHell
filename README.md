### theCommuteFromHell
The Commute From Hell was a game I developed while at MakeGamesWithUs Summer Academy (now known as Make School Summer Academy). This was an 8-week course designed to teach students to develop mobile games for iOS. By the end of the 8 weeks I was successful in releasing my game on the Apple App Store. It now has over 100 downloads.
