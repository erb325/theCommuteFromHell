<p>Does your commute ever feel like frogger?</p>

<p>If so, The Commute From Hell is right for you. The Commute From Hell is a commute themed running app where you have to run to catch your train while dodging common characters of the city. Some of these obstacles can deplete your health. Others can kill you, like taxis. Everyday items such as umbrellas, canes and strollers can be used as weapons to move obstacles out of your way. The Commute From Hell is the most aggressive commute you will ever experience. </p>

<p>The Commute From Hell was developed by Ember Baker as part of the makeGameWith.us New York Summer Academy. The game was made over the course of their 8-week program, that teaches students how to make iOS games. Ember Baker is a Computer Science student at Bloomsburg University.

<p>The artwork in this game was done by Seth Byrd and Steelfrost. </p>
